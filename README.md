# How we choose to govern ourselves, and why.

# Organization (Org. Structure)
The fairly traditional and somewhat top down structure of the organization is to provide the community with discipline within a needed area of expertise. A manager works with their group to ensure each member is a high functioning and skilled worker who is committed to development of their practice. Managers will have domain expertise in the type of work, and guidance on how the work should be done; with the notion that general or standardization of practices to meet goals is well defined and understood.
Day to day interactions are not required; weekly 1:1 meetings are. Regular team cadence, and information sharing practices to suite the needs the team are also needed.
Not everyone has to become a manager of people to progress in their career.

## Goals
Everyone has a manager, each manager has less than 10 people they are managing at any given time.
Career development, opportunities, growth.

# Team
The 'teams', equate to value streams in the business. This is useful as we can organize ourselves into whole engines of success around diverse problem sets that come with the need to have special skill sets.
This enables people to gain deep knowledge in specific areas of our business, and continuously drive improvents, and solutions into these areas.
This enables the business to justify budget against the work that we are doing, and track financial due diligence against market forcasting and demand.

## Goals
Teams will grow and shrink depending on the demand on the business. The main evaluation occurs quarterly; and bi-weekly in reviews with the business. Major changes to teams, are relatively infrequent. As we are in a growth phase, we are nurturing new teams, and diviting them as is required.
Teams; greater than 4, less than 20.

# Work Groups
Self assembling teams around interests, commercial or other.

## Goals
Inclusive, self-joining, self-administrating
