# How we choose to govern ourselves, and why.

# Organization (Org. Structure)
The fairly traditional and somewhat top down structure of the organization is to provide the community with discipline within a needed area of expertise. A manager works with their group to ensure each member is a high functioning and skilled worker who is committed to development of their practice. Managers will have domain expertise in the type of work, and guidance on how the work should be done; with the notion that general or standardization of practices to meet goals is well defined and understood.
Day to day interactions are not required; weekly 1:1 meetings are. Regular team cadence, and information sharing practices to suite the needs the team are also needed.
